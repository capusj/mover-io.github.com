## Announcing Google Cloud Storage Support

![Mover and Google Cloud Storage][1]

We're happy to introduce [Google Cloud Storage][2] as the newest member of the our Connector family!

Google Cloud Storage is a a powerful, simple and cost effective object storage service for developers and IT organizations. Google Cloud offers three different levels of storage via the same API – including Nearline, "cold" (offline) storage for your data that can be retrieved almost instantaneously.

### Why Make The Switch?

Our answer: because you can. Mover empowers people to put their data wherever they want, whether it's for pricing, availability, or features within a particular ecosystem.

Google has made a pretty convincing argument when it comes to storage – even when your data is offline, it should still be accessible relatively quickly (or in their case within seconds). Most other companies offering a similar service require multiple hours to retrieve your data from cold storage.

That's a few hours difference between getting back to work when you need to restore after a system crash or in a disaster recovery situation, all stored inexpensively.

### Getting Into Google Cloud

Using Mover, getting your data into Google Cloud Storage is a breeze ([just make sure you've enabled interoperability, first][5]). Using our app, you can create a new Connector for it in less than a minute – provided you've got your credentials handy.
