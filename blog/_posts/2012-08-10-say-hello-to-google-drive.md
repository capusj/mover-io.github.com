## Say Hello to Google Drive

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/blog/2012-08-10_google-drive.png" class="pull-left p-r-md">

Today is the unveiling of Mover’s Google Drive Connector (cue fireworks)! Now users can transfer and backup their files to or from their Google Drive accounts with the help of Mover’s migration and backup services! 

Google is a pretty busy company, and provides quite a few products and services. One of the most notable is Google Drive, Google’s answer to cloud computing.  Providing cloud storage, file sharing, and collaborative editing all through one platform is impressive, and we wouldn’t expect anything less from Google. As the successor to Google Docs, Drive is providing an array of services, and also keeps users close to Google’s other products. With the Mover Google Drive Connector, we’re connecting users’ data to the rest of the cloud, keeping it accessible and secure. 

We’re excited to see what people are going to do with this Connector, given the massive variety of uses and users of Google Drive!  Some of the frequent uses we’re seeing with the current users are things such as migrating team files between Drive and Dropbox and scheduling backups for business files onto separate cloud storages, but every day we’re seeing interesting and unique uses for the service!
