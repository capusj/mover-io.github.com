## 19 Cloud Connectors!

Big things are happening at Mover! We're enhancing our services, improving our accessibility, and spreading our reach. With the welcome addition of Rackspace, and our friends in Iceland, at GreenQloud, our expanded portfolio now includes 19 cloud connectors!

[Rackspace][2] delivers enterprise-class hybrid cloud infrastructures to  businesses of all sizes and kinds around the world. They combine public cloud, private cloud, and dedicated bare metal computing to provide the perfect infrastructure for each of their customer's specific needs.

[GreenQloud](http://greenqloud.com) is our first connector outside of North America! They offer the world's first Truly Greenâ„¢ public compute cloud, fully hosted at renewable energy-powered facilities. Wanna know how much carbon you're saving? They can tell you! Live monitoring of your energy metrics and carbon savings is all part of the deal. GreenQloud also fully implements Amazon EC2 and S3 APIs. We're inspired to be partnering with GreenQloud as they work to achieve a cleaner IT industry.

As our base of cloud connectors continues to increase and improve, so does our ability to be the best platform for moving files in the cloud. Our newly expanded portfolio, means greater accessibility and movement for users between clouds. As a result we now transfer an average of 1.5 million files a day!
