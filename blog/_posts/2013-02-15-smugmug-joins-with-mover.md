## SmugMug Joins With Mover

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/blog/2013-02-15_smugmug.png" class="pull-left p-r-md">

The Mover team is excited to announce we are now supporting SmugMug with our new SmugMug Connector! Users can use this new Connector to migrate and backup their files to and from SmugMug! 

SmugMug's tagline is "Your photos look better here", and we at Mover couldn't agree more. SmugMug is a great place to store, share, and buy/sell photos, and it helps millions of people access billions of photos. Mover is excited to add SmugMug as a Connector for our services, and we look forward to helping people better access their precious memories and works of art. 

Through SmugMug you can share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and email, as well as access them on mobile devices. Now with the SmugMug Connector, you can get your photos securely across the cloud. 

Just like how SmugMug accommodates all their customers' photo needs, Mover is doing the same with this Connector. Whether you are a professional photographer looking to backup your portfolio to another secure storage provider, an amateur looking to share photos onto a friend's Dropbox, or a business looking to schedule backups for your files (and everything in between), this Mover Connector is here to make the process a breeze.
