## Free Backups for World Backup Day

Did you know, back in 2012, we were looking for an easy way to backup our web content, and we couldn't find one â€“ so we built Mover! We understand that data is the bloodline of your company and without it, you're in big, big trouble. _Stuff happens._ Natural disaster, malicious employees, or someone just making a mistake makes having a second and even third copy of your data one of your biggest assets.

Today we're happy to pledge our support to [World Backup Day][1]! At Mover we are firm believers in creating secure and continuous backups of both your personal and company data.

In order to honour our pledge to help the world create backups, **Mover is helping everyone backup for free, with a 15 GB transfer credit!** We only ask that you help spread the word with a Tweet or public Facebook share linking to this blog post between now and March 31st at midnight.

**Update: This promotion is now over! Thanks to everyone who participated.**

Where do you back up your data to? Let us know on [Twitter][3], [Facebook][4], [Google+][5], or in the comments below.
