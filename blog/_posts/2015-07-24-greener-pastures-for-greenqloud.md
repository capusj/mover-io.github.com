## Greener Pastures for GreenQloud

![Alt Text]({{ site.url }}/img/blog/2015-07-24_pasture.png)

A few months ago, [GreenQloud announced that they will be shutting down their public cloud services on October 1st, 2015](https://www.greenqloud.com/truly-green-public-qloud/).

The company was founded in 2010 to be a 100% green solution to public cloud storage and computing, with locations in Iceland and an American location in Seattle both powered by renewable energy.

> We have decided to remove the ability to create a new GreenQloud connector in our app, but will allow our users currently running scheduled transfers to or from their service to continue using it until GreenQloud’s API is no longer available.

We’re sad to see them go, but wish them luck with their other focus, [QStack – a cloud infrastructure management platform](https://www.qstack.com/), which lets organizations run their own public, private, or hybrid clouds.
