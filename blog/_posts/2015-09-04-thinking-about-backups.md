## Thinking About Backups

![Alt Text]({{ site.url }}/img/blog/2015-09-04_papers.jpg)

A little while ago, we had a user submit an odd [Feature Request](http://support.mover.io/forums/153986-feature-requests/suggestions/8619526-idea):

> Backup my memories and thoughts to something smart searchable.

Which got us thinking about backups – if you had to backup your priceless memories and thoughts (and we hope you’re at least doing this with your personal & work files), where would you store them? What criteria would you use in selecting a cloud storage provider to keep your valuable data safe?

### Price

What are your thoughts and memories worth to you? It seems like a silly question, until you realize that millions of people already regularly backup their photos and videos using services like [Google Photos](https://blog.mover.io/2015/05/29/moving-to-google-photos/) or [Dropbox]({{ site.url }}/connectors/dropbox/) so that they never have to worry about that.

Most of these services are free – or have free tiers – and also let you backup other data to them for safe storage. If you’re storing larger amounts of data, services like [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/) only cost cent(s) per gigabyte stored – which is nothing compared to the cost of losing your data.

### Reliability

All cloud storage providers probably provide a much more reliable storage and retrieval system than your own head does. They don’t need to use mnemonics or strings around their fingers for recall.

You probably wouldn’t rely on your mind to hold on to everything, either – it’s likely you’d write it down somewhere. The same applies to your data! Whether cloud services experience downtime or [shut down outright](http://blog.canonical.com/2014/04/02/shutting-down-ubuntu-one-file-services/), it’s a good idea to have your data in multiple locations. This is where Mover can come in, to help you create copies of your files on multiple cloud services.

Additionally, we definitely recommend you read (or at least skim) the Service Level Agreement (SLA) of the services you’re choosing so you understand what happens in extraneous circumstances and to understand what provisions are in place to protect your data.

### Security

Obviously, your thoughts and memories are pretty secure in your head – so far – but what do cloud services have to offer?

It’s been proven that cloud services are more secure than traditional IT security allows for – the security costs are spread out across multiple users and organizations on the same service, and these people are experts. This lets a skilled group of people secure billions of files instead of your own IT team being forced to choose between fighting off hackers or helping an employee resolve a blue screen of death.

A good thing to keep in mind when talking about cloud security is that most security breaches are not due to faulty methods employed by the cloud vendor, but by social engineering or phishing, which are both end user exploits that can only be fought with education and training.

Additionally, all services offer varying degrees of encryption for your data. When Mover moves your files, we also add another layer while in transit. For more information, you can check out our Mover Security Whitepaper.
