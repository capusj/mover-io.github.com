## Mover Welcomes Box

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/blog/2012-08-15_box.png" class="pull-left p-r-md">

We are proud to announce our Box Connector for Mover’s services! Box users can now use Mover’s migration and backup tools to safely and quickly transfer and backup their files to or from Box!  Mover’s Box Connector opens up the cloud-based web immensely, and allows us to help people move their files in tremendous ways. 

Box is the world leader for file migrations, and one of the strongest cloud platforms in the world. They cater to anyone and everyone, from personal use to small businesses to enterprise integration. With the amount of use Box sees, we couldn’t be happier about partnering with them to help expand their services and offer both their users even more accessibility to their files. 

The Box Connector works just like our other Connectors and allows users to migrate and backup their files with us, but we’re really interested in seeing how the vast client base of Box makes use of the service. Being able to see how different personal, business, and enterprise clients use the Connector to optimize their usage of Box will be very helpful as we grow and expand, and this Connector is a huge step towards our vision of a massive interconnected web where information is no longer isolated. 

Thanks for reading about our Box Connector! Don't forget to check us out on our [Twitter][2], [LinkedIn][3], [Google+][4], and [Facebook ][5]pages!
