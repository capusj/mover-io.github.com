## SkyDrive (now OneDrive) Joins Mover

Our developers here at Mover have been working hard, and it's time to show off some of that hard work! We're proud to announce that Microsoft SkyDrive users will now be able to migrate and backup their files to and from SkyDrive with Mover's SkyDrive Connector! 

SkyDrive is Microsoft's answer to cloud computing and file hosting. As a subsection of Windows Live online services, SkyDrive is fully integrated into Windows' online platforms such as Outlook, Office Web Apps, and of course the renowned Microsoft Office Suite. This means that SkyDrive can be a powerful one-stop location for your file hosting and synchronization needs. But we here at Mover know the internet is rarely a one-stop place, and that is why we have brought SkyDrive on as a Mover Connector. 

One of the biggest advantages and reasons for these "fully-loaded" services like SkyDrive and Google Drive is compatibility issues. At Mover; however, we're helping clear the way to free your data across the cloud-based web. This Connector is helping our users integrate SkyDrive even more into their internet use, such as by securely transferring their files to or from SkyDrive without compatibility headaches, or backing up their important Office documents, presentations, and spreadsheets. 

With a company like Microsoft behind it, we know that SkyDrive will continue to grow and develop and offer its users even more, and we're excited to have our Mover SkyDrive Connector be a part of that. 

Thanks for reading about our SkyDrive Connector! Don't forget to check us out on our [Twitter][2], [LinkedIn][3], [Google+][4], and [Facebook ][5]pages!
