## Moving to Google Photos

![Moving to Google Photos][1]  
With the [recent separation of Google Photos from Google+][2], lots of people are looking for a reason to take advantage of the _free, unlimited storage_ the service provides for photos. Here's a quick rundown on how to use Mover to get your photos into Google's new photo service – **free from one Personal Connector to another**!  

### Checking For Google Photos

![Google Photos][3]

Most Google Drive accounts should already have the Google Photos option on the left hand side. If you don't yet, it might be due to the type of account (i.e. Google Drive for Work) or when you signed up for Drive.  

### Unlocking The Photos Folder

![Settings][4]

In order for Mover to be able to get at your Google Photos, you'll need to make sure you've added the appropriate folder to Google Drive. To access your Google Photos folder in Google Drive, you'll want to follow these steps:

* Click the **gear icon** on the top right, under your Google avatar picture.
* Click on **Settings**.
* At the bottom of the general settings is an option that reads "**Create a Google Photos folder.**" Check this box and hit **Done**.

To migrate your photos, [open up our app][7] and connect your Google Drive account – if you haven't done this before, we have an article on how to do just that in our Knowledge Base [here][8]. You'll also want to connect whatever service you want to migrate from.

From there, it's a few simple steps in our app. [Piece of cake][9]!

_June 3, 2015 – It looks as though you'll also need to enable Google Photos to see the files in Google Drive. This setting can be found at [https://photos.google.com/settings](https://photos.google.com/settings) and it appears at this time that these photos will count towards your storage quota._
