## Mover And SharePoint!

<img src="{{ site.url }}/img/blog/2013-03-07_sharepoint.png" class="pull-left p-r-md">

We are pleased to announce our official [SharePoint integration][2]! Now anyone can use Mover to transfer files in and out of SharePoint libraries.

At this time we support SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013. You can easily connect to a SharePoint site in the Mover interface and transfer files to anything like Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive. You can even move files back into SharePoint! 

Some of our beta users are already using Mover to backup their SharePoint libraries. We are also seeing such use cases like scheduled transfer of files from SharePoint into a secondary system like Box. This can help marketing, sales, technical teams distribute files from an old SharePoint site to a newer cloud storage provider. 

Heck, some people are even moving files between their SharePoint sites! 

The great thing about Mover is that we let you decide why you need to move files. We simply enable you to move as much as you want, whenever you want. 

If you haven't already, go [sign up][3] and try our SharePoint connector. 

Make sure to follow us on [Twitter][4] and [LinkedIn][5], and like us on [Facebook][6] and [Google+][7]!
