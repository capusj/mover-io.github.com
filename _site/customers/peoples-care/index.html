        <h2>People’s Care Migrated With Mover</h2>
        <p><img src="/img/customers/peoples-care-header.png"></p>
        <p><em>CEO Mike Kaiser founded <a href="http://www.peoplescare.com/" target="_blank">People’s Care</a> based on the philosophy of “Personal Choice, Community Involvement and Dignity.” Today, the People’s Care mission is: “To Provide Excellent Support and Advocacy for Individuals in a Positive, Life-Enriching Environment.”</em></p>

        <h3>A Cloud-First Company</h3>
        <p>As a traditional residential and special needs care provider, People’s Care care is staying ahead of the competition by innovating wherever they can. Using collaborative technology to improve their level of service was an obvious win for Director of IT Services, Ray Fabro. Years ago People’s Care adopted the well-known <a href="https://mover.io/connectors/box">Box</a> service to replace their local file shares. Today they have more complex needs, including calendaring, email, as well as file syncing and sharing.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
          “The vision for People’s Care is be a leader in our industry, in care, service, and technology. It is our goal to leverage technology to create and support a transparent and seamless environment which will foster collaboration and continuous innovation.”
        </p></blockquote>

        <h3>Switching Clouds</h3>
        <p>Moving to <a href="https://mover.io/google/">Google Apps for Work</a> was an easy choice to make. Working closely with Sprint, a Google Premier partner, Mr. Fabro decided that having each employee at People’s Care fully utilizing the power of Google Apps, and specifically Google Drive would further enhance his company’s ability to compete.</p>
        <p>Most concerns were focused on how the switch over would affect end users. Top of mind for Mr. Fabro was “How much disruption would be caused by the move from Box to Google? Would the move be seamless to our user base? Would all the data and sharing permissions remain intact?”</p>
        <p>Utilizing Mover, the transition from Box to Google Drive was painless and streamlined.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
          “Simply put, this was the easiest and smoothest migration I have ever been involved in.” said Fabro.
        </p></blockquote>
        <p><img src="/img/customers/peoples-care-move.png"></p>

        <h3>Preparing for the Switch</h3>
        <p>Luckily, Fabro was migrating to Google Drive, into which Mover has perfected its Migrations. Data structures in practically any other cloud storage provider are different, and Mover can handily replicate any other folder structure in Google Drive.</p>
        <p>In preparation for the move, Fabro and his team communicated internally regarding the purpose, the process, and timelines. He made sure all users were aware of what was going on, when things were happening, and what to expect.</p>
        <p>Part of this preparation was identifying which users would be migrating, and get complete usernames from both sides. In this case, People’s Care had many external users in Box under a separate domain name, and Mover was able to map them to their correct Google Drive user under their new primary domain.</p>
        <h3>Employee Communication</h3>
        <p>One of the key things to consider when migrating to Google Drive is how to communicate this change with your employees. Fabro and Sprint jointly tackled the task of training each employee on the ins and outs of Google Drive, and explained how Mover would be moving data. “Having to train each employee on a new system is a challenge, and having Mover migrate our data and permissions saved us weeks of extra work.” adds Fabro.</p>
        <p>For the end user, Mover never disturbs data. Since Mover performs a straight copy, behind the scenes, all People’s Care employees were undisturbed and experienced virtually no downtime during the migration.</p>
        <h3>A Staged Migration</h3>
        <p>Fabro elected for a staged migration, where his team deployed some users in to Google Drive and ran them alongside Box to suss out the nuances between the platforms before committing the entire firm. This worked out well, and Mover migrated Mr. Fabro’s IT team for them to test.</p>
        <blockquote><p>
          “Everyone in the IT department was impressed with Mover,” remarks Fabro, and so the rest of the company’s migration was scheduled for the near future.
        </p></blockquote>

        <h3>Hitting the Ground Running</h3>
        <p>Mover started migrating all data on a Friday afternoon. This copy of files happened in the background and no users were disturbed by our work. By Monday morning nearly everything was migrated and Fabro and his team were able to get back to work quickly now using Google Drive for Work.</p>
        <p>With very little downtime, Ray Fabro and the employees at People’s Care were able to swiftly enjoy their new home in Google Drive.</p>
