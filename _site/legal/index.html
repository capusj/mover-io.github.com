          <h2>Security Overview</h2>
          <p>Last modified: January 7th, 2015</p>

          <p>We provide this overview so that you can better understand the security measures we’ve put in place to protect the information that you transmit using Mover.</p>

          <h3>Secure Storage</h3>
          <p>We encrypt the files that you transmit through Mover using the AES-256 standard, which is the same encryption standard used by banks to secure customer data. Encryption for your files is applied as soon we receive them, and we manage the encryption keys.</p>

          <p>Mover uses Amazon EC2, Rackspace, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and other custom hosted servers for our server infrastructure. Amazon stores data over several large-scale data centers. According to Amazon, they use military grade perimeter control berms, video surveillance, and professional security staff to keep their data centers physically secure.</p>

          <p>You can find more information about Amazon’s security at the Amazon Web Services’ website.</p>

          <h3>Secure Transfers</h3>
          <p>If supported, your files are sent between the services you choose and our servers over a secure channel using 256-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, the standard for secure Internet network connections.</p>

          <h3>Your Data is Not Retained by Mover</h3>
          <p>After we have completed transmission of your data between the services you have directed us to use we remove any copies of your data from our servers. We simply facilitate the transfer of your data and we have no interest in, or benefit from, retaining your data.</p>

          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          <p>We guard your privacy to the best of our ability and work hard to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>

          <p>Mover employees are prohibited from viewing the content of files you transmit through Mover, and are only permitted to view file metadata (e.g., file names and locations). Like most online services, we have a small number of employees who must be able to access user data for the reasons stated in our privacy policy (e.g., when legally required to do so). But that’s the rare exception, not the rule. We have strict policy and technical access controls that prohibit employee access except in these rare circumstances. In addition, we employ a number of physical and electronic security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access.</p>

          <p>On the rare occasion, Mover employees may access your connections and files only to fix bugs or troubleshoot problems have been identified.</p>

          <h3>Compliance With Laws and Law Enforcement</h3>
          <p>As set forth in our privacy policy, and in compliance with Canadian law, Mover cooperates with Canadian law enforcement when it receives valid legal process, which may require Mover to provide the contents of files we currently possess. In these cases, Mover will remove Mover’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. Since we do not retain any files after their transmission it is highly unlikely that we will have any of your personal data on hand if such a legal request occurs.</p>

          <h3>How to Add Your Own Layer of Encryption to Mover</h3>
          <p>Mover applies encryption to your files after they have been uploaded, and we manage the encryption keys. Users who wish to manage their own encryption keys can apply encryption before transmitting files through Mover. Please note that if you encrypt files before transmitting them, some features may not be available.</p>

          <h3>Where Do I Report Security Concerns?</h3>
          <p>We take a number of measures to ensure that the data you transmit through Mover is safe and secure. While we’re very confident in our technology, we recognize that no system can guarantee data security with 100% certainty. For that reason, we will continue to innovate to make sure that our security measures are state of the art, and we will investigate any and all reported security issues concerning Mover’s services or software. For a direct line to our security experts, report security issues to support@mover.io.</p>

          <p>We will fully credit anybody whose reports lead to the improvement of Mover security.</p>

          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>Last modified: January 7th, 2015</p>

          <p>This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. Users can access the Mover service (the “Service”) through our website mover.io, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “Device” is any computer used to access the Mover Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Mover Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”</p>

          <h3>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND STORE</h3>
          <p>We may collect and store the following information when running the Mover Service:</p>

          <h3>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE</h3>

          <p>When you register an account, we may collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. When you invite others to join Mover by using our referral page, we send them a one-time email for that referral. You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer Mover to you.</p>

          <h3>FILES</h3>

          <p>We temporarily collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Mover Service (“Files”). Once we have finished moving or manipulating your Files we automatically and permanently delete them from our servers.</p>

          <h3>LOG DATA</h3>

          <p>When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.</p>

          <h3>COOKIES</h3>

          <p>We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.</p>

          <h2>HOW WE USE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

          <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

          <p>In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications.</p>

          <h3>ANALYTICS</h3>

          <p>We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests. As of the last modified data of this policy, we use Google Analytics, Keen.io, and Optimizely.</p>

          <h2>INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</h2>

          <h3>THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS</h3>

          <p>We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.</p>

          <h3>COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUESTS; PROTECTION OF MOVER’S RIGHTS</h3>

          <p>We may disclose to parties outside Mover files stored in Mover and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Mover or its users; or (d) to protect Mover’s property rights. If we provide your Mover files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove Mover’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, Mover will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on Mover.</p>

          <h3>BUSINESS TRANSFERS</h3>

          <p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.</p>

          <h3>NON-PRIVATE OR NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

          <p>We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service.</p>

          <h3>CHANGING OR DELETING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

          <p>If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing your “account settings.” If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your account settings. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact support@mover.io. We will respond to your inquiry within 30 days.</p>

          <h3>DATA RETENTION</h3>

          <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please contact support@mover.io. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.</p>

          <h3>MOVER COMMUNITY</h3>

          <p>Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account. For questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact support@mover.io.</p>

          <p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Mover. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit.</p>

          <h3>SECURITY</h3>

          <p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

          <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can view our Security Overview Section or contact us at support@mover.io.</p>

          <h3>OUR POLICY TOWARD CHILDREN</h3>

          <p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at support@mover.io. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.</p>

          <h3>CONTACTING US</h3>

          <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@mover.io or at #205, 10355 Jasper Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta, T5J 1Y6</p>

          <h3>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

          <p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

          <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
          <p><em>Last modified: December 18, 2014</em></p>
          <p>This Agreement (the “Agreement”) is between Mover Inc., a Canadian corporation (“Mover”) and the organization agreeing to these terms (“Customer”). This Agreement governs access to and use of the Mover client software (“Software”) and services (together, the “Services” or “Mover”). By signing your contract for the Services or using the Services, you agree to this Agreement as a Customer. If you are agreeing to this Agreement for use of the Services by an organization, you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of that organization. You must have the authority to bind that organization to this Agreement, otherwise you must not sign up for the Services.</p>
          <h3>Services.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Provision of Services.</strong> Customer and users of Customer’s Services account (“<strong>End Users</strong>“) may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>Facilities and Data Processing.</strong> Mover will use, at a minimum, industry standard technical and organizational security measures to transfer, store, and process Customer Data. These measures are designed to protect the integrity of Customer Data and guard against the unauthorized or unlawful access to, use, and processing of Customer Data. Customer agrees that Mover may transfer, store, and process Customer Data in locations other than Customer’s country. </li>
          <li><strong>Modifications to the Services.</strong> Mover may update the Services from time to time. If Mover changes the Services in a manner that materially reduces their functionality, Mover will inform Customer via the email address associated with the account.</li>
          <li><strong>Software.</strong> Some Services allow Customer to download Mover Software which may update automatically. Customer may use the Software only to access the Services. If any component of the Software is offered under an open source license, Mover will make the license available to Customer and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of the terms of this Agreement.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Customer Obligations.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Compliance.</strong> Customer is responsible for use of the Services by its End Users. Customer and its End Users must use the Services in compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy. Customer will obtain from End Users any consents necessary to allow Administrators to engage in the activities described in this Agreement and to allow Mover to provide the Services. Customer will comply with laws and regulations applicable to Customer’s use of the Services, if any.</li>
          <li><strong>Customer Administration of the Services.</strong> Customer may specify End Users as “<strong>Administrators</strong>“. Administrators may have the ability to access, disclose, restrict or remove Customer Data in or from Services accounts. Administrators may also have the ability to monitor, restrict, or terminate access to Services accounts. Mover’s responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Services. Customer is responsible for: (i) maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and Administrator accounts; (ii) managing access to Administrator accounts; and (iii) ensuring that Administrators’ use of the Services complies with this Agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>Unauthorized Use &amp; Access.</strong> Customer will prevent unauthorized use of the Services by its End Users and terminate any unauthorized use of or access to the Services. The Services are not intended for End Users under the age of 13. Customer will ensure that it does not allow any person under 13 to use the Services. Customer will promptly notify Mover of any unauthorized use of or access to the Services.</li>
          <li><strong>Restricted Uses.</strong> Customer will not (i) sell, resell, or lease the Services; (ii) use the Services for activities where use or failure of the Services could lead to physical damage, death, or personal injury; or (iii) reverse engineer the Services, nor attempt nor assist anyone else to do so, unless this restriction is prohibited by law.</li>
          <li><strong>Third Party Requests.</strong><br>
          a) “<strong>Third Party Request</strong>” means a request from a third party for records relating to an End User’s use of the Services including information in or from an End User or Customer’s Services account. Third Party Requests may include valid search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas, or any other request for which there is written consent from End Users permitting a disclosure.<br>
          b) Customer is responsible for responding to Third Party Requests via its own access to information. Customer will seek to obtain information required to respond to Third Party Requests and will contact Mover only if it cannot obtain such information despite diligent efforts.<br>
          c) Mover will make commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent allowed by law and by the terms of the Third Party Request, to: (A) promptly notify Customer of Mover’s receipt of a Third Party Request; (B) comply with Customer’s commercially reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third Party Request; and (C) provide Customer with information or tools required for Customer to respond to the Third Party Request (if Customer is otherwise unable to obtain the information). If Customer fails to promptly respond to any Third Party Request, then Mover may, but will not be obligated to do so.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Third-Party Services.</h3>
          <p>If Customer uses any third-party service (e.g., a service that uses a Mover API) with the Services, (a) Mover will not be responsible for any act or omission of the third party, including the third party’s access to or use of Customer Data and (b) Mover does not warrant or support any service provided by the third party.</p>
          <h3>Suspensions.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Of End User Accounts by Mover.</strong> If an End User (i) violates this Agreement or (ii) uses the Services in a manner that Mover reasonably believes will cause it liability, then Mover may request that Customer suspend or terminate the applicable End User account. If Customer fails to promptly suspend or terminate the End User account, then Mover may do so.</li>
          <li><strong>Security Emergencies.</strong> Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if there is a Security Emergency then Mover may automatically suspend use of the Services. Mover will make commercially reasonable efforts to narrowly tailor the suspension as needed to prevent or terminate the Security Emergency. “<strong>Security Emergency</strong>” means: (i) use of the Services that do or could disrupt the Services, other customers’ use of the Services, or the infrastructure used to provide the Services and (ii) unauthorized third-party access to the Services.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Intellectual Property Rights.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Reservation of Rights.</strong> Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not grant (i) Mover any Intellectual Property Rights in Customer Data or (ii) Customer any Intellectual Property Rights in the Services or Mover trademarks and brand features. “<strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong>” means current and future worldwide rights under patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, moral rights, and other similar rights.</li>
          <li><strong>Limited Permission.</strong> Customer grants Mover only the limited rights that are reasonably necessary for Mover to offer the Services (e.g., hosting Stored Data). This permission also extends to trusted third parties Mover works with to offer the Services (e.g., payment provider used to process payment of fees).</li>
          <li><strong>Suggestions.</strong> Mover may, at its discretion and for any purpose, use, modify, and incorporate into its products and services, license and sublicense, any feedback, comments, or suggestions Customer or End Users send Mover or post in Mover’s forums without any obligation to Customer.</li>
          <li><strong>Customer List.</strong> Mover may include Customer’s name in a list of Mover customers on the Mover website or in promotional materials.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Fees &amp; Payment.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Fees.</strong> Customer will pay, and authorizes Mover to charge using Customer’s selected payment method, for all applicable fees. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Mover . Mover may suspend or terminate the Services if fees are past due.</li>
          <li><strong>Auto Renewals and Trials.</strong> IF CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT IS SET TO AUTO RENEWAL OR IS IN A TRIAL PERIOD, MOVER MAY AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR FOR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS CUSTOMER NOTIFIES MOVER THAT CUSTOMER WANTS TO CANCEL OR DISABLE AUTO RENEWAL. Mover may revise Service rates by providing Customer at least 30 days notice prior to the next charge.</li>
          <li><strong>Taxes.</strong> Customer is responsible for all taxes. Mover will charge tax when required to do so. If Customer is required by law to withhold any taxes, Customer must provide Mover with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Purchase Orders.</strong> If Customer requires the use of a purchase order or purchase order number, Customer (i) must provide the purchase order number at the time of purchase and (ii) agrees that any terms and conditions on a Customer purchase order will not apply to this Agreement and are null and void.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Term &amp; Termination.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Term.</strong> This Agreement will remain in effect until Customer’s subscription to the Services expires or terminates, or until the Agreement is terminated.</li>
          <li><strong>Termination for Breach.</strong> Either Mover or Customer may terminate this Agreement if: (i) the other party is in material breach of the Agreement and fails to cure that breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice or (ii) the other party ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within 90 days.</li>
          <li><strong>Effects of Termination.</strong> If this Agreement terminates: (i) the rights granted by Mover to Customer will cease immediately (except as set forth in this section); (ii) Mover may provide Customer access to its account at then-current fees so that Customer may export its Stored Data; and (iii) after a commercially reasonable period of time, Mover may delete any Stored Data relating to Customer’s account. The following sections will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement: 2(e) (Third Party Requests), 5 (Intellectual Property Rights), 6 (Fees &amp; Payment), 7(c) (Effects of Termination), 8 (Indemnification), 9 (Disclaimers), 10 (Limitation of Liability), 11 (Disputes), and 12 (Miscellaneous).</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Indemnification.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>By Customer.</strong> Customer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Mover from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim by a third party against Mover and its affiliates regarding: (i) Customer Data; (ii) Customer’s use of the Services in violation of this Agreement; or (iii) End Users’ use of the Services in violation of this Agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>By Mover.</strong> Mover will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer from and against all liabilities, damages, and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim by a third party against Customer to the extent based on an allegation that Mover’s technology used to provide the Services to the Customer infringes or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S. patent, or trademark right of the third party. In no event will Mover have any obligations or liability under this section arising from: (i) use of any Services in a modified form or in combination with materials not furnished by Mover and (ii) any content, information, or data provided by Customer, End Users, or other third parties.</li>
          <li><strong>Possible Infringement.</strong> If Mover believes the Services infringe or may be alleged to infringe a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights, then Mover may: (i) obtain the right for Customer, at Mover’s expense, to continue using the Services; (ii) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; or (iii) modify the Services so that they no longer infringe. If Mover does not believe the options described in this section are commercially reasonable then Mover may suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the affected Services (with a pro-rata refund of prepaid fees for the Services).</li>
          <li><strong>General.</strong> The party seeking indemnification will promptly notify the other party of the claim and cooperate with the other party in defending the claim. The indemnifying party will have full control and authority over the defense, except that: (i) any settlement requiring the party seeking indemnification to admit liability requires prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and (ii) the other party may join in the defense with its own counsel at its own expense. THE INDEMNITIES ABOVE ARE MOVER AND CUSTOMER’S ONLY REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR VIOLATION BY THE OTHER PARTY OF A THIRD PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Disclaimers.</h3>
          <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR MOVER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING AND BACKING UP ANY STORED DATA.</p>
          <h3>Limitation of Liability.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Limitation on Indirect Liability.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EXCEPT FOR MOVER OR CUSTOMER’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR MOVER AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR (I) INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR (II) LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, REVENUES, OR PROFITS (IN EACH CASE WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), EVEN IF THE PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</li>
          <li><strong>Limitation on Amount of Liability.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, MOVER’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF $100,000 OR THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER TO MOVER HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Disputes.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Informal Resolution.</strong> Mover wants to address your concerns without resorting to a formal legal case. Before filing a claim, each party agrees to try to resolve the dispute by contacting the other party through the notice procedures in section 12(e). If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of notice, Customer or Mover may bring a formal proceeding.</li>
          <li><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> Customer and Mover agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth below. The arbitration will be held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, or any other location both parties agree to in writing.</li>
          <li><strong>Exception to Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> Either party may bring a lawsuit in the federal or provincial courts of Edmonton, Alberta solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights without first engaging in the informal dispute notice process described above. Both Customer and Mover consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.</li>
          <li><strong>NO CLASS ACTIONS.</strong> Customer may only resolve disputes with Mover on an individual basis and will not bring a claim in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Miscellaneous.</h3>
          <ol>
          <li><strong>Terms Modification.</strong> Mover may revise this Agreement from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on the Mover website. If a revision, in Mover’s sole discretion, is material, Mover will notify Customer (by, for example, sending an email to the email address associated with the applicable account). Other revisions may be posted to Mover’s blog or terms page, and Customer is responsible for checking such postings regularly. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, Customer agrees to be bound by the revised Agreement. If Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement terms, Customer may terminate the Services within 30 days of receiving notice of the change.</li>
          <li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement, including Customer’s invoice and order form, constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Mover with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes and replaces any prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. If there is a conflict between the documents that make up this Agreement, the documents will control in the following order: the invoice, the order form, the Agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>Governing Law.</strong> THE AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY ALBERTA LAW EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES.</li>
          <li><strong>Severability.</strong> Unenforceable provisions will be modified to reflect the parties’ intention and only to the extent necessary to make them enforceable, and the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect.</li>
          <li><strong>Notice.</strong> Notices must be sent via first class, airmail, or overnight courier and are deemed given when received. Notices to Customer may also be sent to the applicable account email address and are deemed given when sent. Notices to Mover must be sent to Mover Inc. Suite 409, 10310 102 Avenue NW, Edmonton, AB, Canada, T5J 2X6, with a copy to the Legal Department.</li>
          <li><strong>Waiver.</strong> A waiver of any default is not a waiver of any subsequent default.</li>
          <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> Customer may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of Mover . Mover may not assign this Agreement without providing notice to Customer, except Mover may assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations under this Agreement to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets without providing notice. Any other attempt to transfer or assign is void.</li>
          <li><strong>No Agency.</strong> Mover and Customer are not legal partners or agents, but are independent contractors.</li>
          <li><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Except for payment obligations, neither Mover nor Customer will be liable for inadequate performance to the extent caused by a condition that was beyond the party’s reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, act of war or terrorism, riot, labor condition, governmental action, and Internet disturbance).</li>
          <li><strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries.</strong> There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. Without limiting this section, a Customer’s End Users are not third-party beneficiaries to Customer’s rights under this Agreement.</li>
