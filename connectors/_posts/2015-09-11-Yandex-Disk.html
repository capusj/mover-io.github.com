      <p>Being able to share and synchronize your files across all your devices with Yandex makes life much simpler, and now with the Mover Yandex Connector, your files can now reach devices beyond Yandex as well!</p>

      <p>This Connector works with all of Mover’s services, allowing you to take advantage of differential transfers, scheduling, archiving, and Mover’s bi-directional compatibility. Users can now manage their files in new ways such as these:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Backing up Yandex Disk files onto separate cloud services.</li>
        <li>Moving files to or from storage sites that do not have Yandex readily available.</li>
        <li>Setting up schedules for file migration and backup with Yandex and other cloud storage services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We here at Mover take security very seriously, and ensure that your files are protected whenever using our services. Each transfer made is encrypted end-to-end and we are constantly revising and improving our security practices.</p>

      <p>Mover’s Yandex Disk Connector is aimed to help you better manage your files with Yandex and other services.</p>
