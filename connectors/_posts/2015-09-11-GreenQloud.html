      <h2>Mover and {{ page.html_title }}</h2>

      <p><b>We have retired support for GreenQloud. Mover will support schedules to and from GreenQloud currently running until their API is no longer accessible, but the ability to create a new connector, schedule, or transfer with the GreenQloud connector has been removed.</b></p>
      
      <p>GreenQloud is a cloud computing company that offers green cloud computing and cloud storage services. With all of their power coming from 100% renewable energy resources, GreenQloud is the green offering for the eco-conscious IT department. With a simple and secure cloud, they operate on a cost per space used system, only paying for the space you are using.</p>

      <p>GreenQloud will be shutting down their public cloud services on October 1st, 2015 in favour of offering other ventures. This means that we will no longer be able to connect to their cloud storage service after this date.</p>
