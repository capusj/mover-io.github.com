      <h2>Mover and {{ page.html_title }}</h2>

      <p>Mover integrates with dozens of different services. One of our largest, and most enterprise driven Connectors is SharePoint.</p>

      <p>Utilizing the Mover SharePoint Connector you can easily move files in and out of your SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013 libraries.</p>

      <p>The Sharepoint Connector supports Mover’s fully bi-directional file transfers, and there are a wide variety of uses for our SharePoint integration. Here are a few:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Migrate your entire organization from SharePoint to another service like <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/box">Box</a> or <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/egnyte">Egnyte</a>.</li>
        <li>Backup your company’s Libraries to an alternate server that you control.</li>
        <li>Schedule ongoing information pushes from SharePoint to an auxiliary system like <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/box">Box</a> or <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/egnyte">Egnyte</a>.</li>
        <li>Get multiple offices on the same page when they deploy different versions of SharePoint.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Mover takes security precautions very seriously. Any time a Connector is used with Sharepoint, whether in, out, or within, the files are encrypted end-to-end. Mover is dedicated to continuously increasing file security for our customers.</p>

      <p>Just like a library card, the Mover SharePoint Connector lets you check files in and out of SharePoint – if you or your team need to move files then our SharePoint library connector is for you!</p>
