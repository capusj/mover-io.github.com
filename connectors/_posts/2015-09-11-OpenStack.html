      <p>OpenStack is a cloud computing project that aims to provide an open source cloud computing platform. The OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) is a scalable redundant system that ensures safe and secure online cloud storage. Mover is able to connect with the OpenStack infrastructure and API while securely transferring files in and out of any service that use this open source software.</p>

      <p>With Mover it is simple and fast to move files in and out of the systems that use the OpenStack cloud structure. It is always important to ensure that your files are in more than one location. This Connector is bi-directionally compatible with all of our other Connectors, as well it can utilize the full range of tools offered by Mover.

        <li>Creating a schedule to manage file transfers and backups with OpenStack and other Connectors.</li>
