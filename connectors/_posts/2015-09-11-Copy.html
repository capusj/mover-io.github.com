      <h2>Mover and {{ page.html_title }}</h2>

      <p>The service was developed by Barracuda, a go-to provider of security and storage IT solutions for more than 150,000 organizations worldwide. As the cloud storage market gets more and more crowded, Copy has set out to differentiate itself from the pack.</p>

      <p>Copy provides an approachable, yet secure and scalable corporate file sharing platform. It is a truly modern and full-featured cloud storage offering that provides great applications for all platforms with specific focus on business users.</p>

      <p>Taking an innovative approach to file sharing, there are many benefits to deploying Copy in your organization. As one of our Partner Connectors, Copy has full support in Mover’s ecosystem and were proud to call the folks over at Copy our friends. Here at Mover we are very excited to help Copy grow as it competes head on with the likes of <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/dropbox">Dropbox</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/box">Box</a>.</p>

        <li>Migrating to or from a Copy for Companies account and an enterprise service like <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/box">Box</a> or <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/egnyte">Egnyte</a>.</li>

      <p>Mover takes security concerns quite seriously. We take every measure to protect your files as they move in and out of Copy through our Connectors.</p>

      <p>That means that every transfer is encrypted end-to-end, and we are always improving our security practices.</p>
