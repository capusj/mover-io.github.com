      <p>OneDrive is Microsoft’s foray into the cloud hosting services. As part of the Windows Live online services, it allows users to store, share, and collaborate on their Microsoft Office files and other Windows Live services such as Outlook mail. With the Mover OneDrive Connector, these services may now reach beyond OneDrive and interact with other cloud services.</p>

      <p>This Connector is bi-directionally compatible with all of Mover’s other Connectors, and can utilize Mover’s full range of services such as creating schedules, archiving, or using differential transfers. Some of the ways this Connector helps make your OneDrive even more functional are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Migrating/backing up your files to or from OneDrive and separate services.</li>
        <li>Sharing large files between your OneDrive and someone on another service.</li>
        <li>Scheduling file migrations/backups with OneDrive and separate services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>File security is taken very seriously here at Mover. and we protect every file you move in or out of OneDrive as securely as we can. All transfers are encrypted end-to-end and we are committed to continuously reviewing and improving your file security.</p>

      <p>With the Mover OneDrive Connector, managing your files in OneDrive has never been easier. Get started today with a free Mover account!</p>
