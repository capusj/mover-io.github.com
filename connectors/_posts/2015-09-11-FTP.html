      <p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is the standard protocol for transferring files between hosts. For years it has allowed users to transmit their information between the user and another client, as well as support website development.</p>

      <p>Some issues that have arisen through FTP, however, have been slow transfer speeds, dependence on your local servers, and limited mobility across platforms. With the Mover FTP Connector, your files and webpages are more accessible than ever before!</p>

      <p>Right now we’re all familiar with just how difficult it is to use technologies like FTP (it’s been around since the seventies, you know!), and that’s why we built Mover.</p>

      <p>Instead of taking HOURS to upload or download your website or other content from your desktop, simply connect your FTP server to Mover and we’ll handle everything for you. You can even turn your computer off and rest assured that Mover will be handling your transfer.</p>

      <p>The FTP Connector utilizes all of Mover’s service offerings, allowing for bi-directional compatibility in transfers, differential transfers, creating schedules, and archiving. Some of the ways Mover is making FTP even better are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Migrating your website from website host to website host seamlessly (ex. GoDaddy to Media Temple).</li>
        <li>Backing up your website to cloud storage.</li>
        <li>Migrating your FTP files to a cloud storage service.</li>
        <li>Backing up your cloud stored files into FTP.</li>
        <li>Removing dependence on local server to drive transfers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At Mover we take your files’ security very seriously, and that means we protect every file you move in or out of FTP as securely as we can. We encrypt each transfer from end-to-end and we are dedicated to constantly improving our security practices.</p>

      <p>We encourage all of our users to take a moment to read through our Security White Paper. With the Mover FTP Connector we aim to help you better manage your FTP based files and websites.</p>
