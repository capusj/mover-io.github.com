      <h2>Mover and {{ page.html_title }}</h2>

      <p>Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is a widely used protocol for managing files between various users.
      It provides the framework for manipulating files through a server, and with Mover’s WebDAV Connector, this framework is now even more integrated and accessible.</p>

      <p>Mover’s WebDAV Connector is fully set up with all other Mover Connectors, and allows for bi-directional compatibility, scheduling, archiving, and differential transfers. With the WebDAV Connector, users can now manage their files in ways such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Backing up your cloud stored files into WebDAV.</li>
        <li>Migrating your WebDAV files to a cloud storage service.</li>
        <li>Migrating your WebDAV files from server to server.</li>
        <li>Scheduling your preferred file migrations and backups.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We at Mover take the security of your files very seriously, and we protect every file you move in and out of WebDAV as securely as we can.</p>

      <p>Every transfer you make is encrypted end-to-end, and Mover is committed to ensuring our security practices are always being reviewed and improved upon.</p>

      <p>With Mover’s WebDAV Connector, you will be able to manage your WebDAV files better than ever before.</p>
