      <p>Office 365 is a great collaborative cloud based service provided by Microsoft with features that range from hosting to regular office applications.</p>

      <p>With Mover anyone can transfer or migrate files in and out of OneDrive for Business. It is often important when using online tools like Office 365 to ensure that you have a backup on another system. Mover makes it simple to do just that, by setting up systematic backups of all new data or files created and stored in the OneDrive for Business portion of Office 365.</p>

      <p>Even though the Microsoft ecosystem can be a little convoluted, at Mover can connect with it all. Thousands of Mover users use our Office 365 integration for a wide variety of reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Backing up working files on a regular schedule.</li>

        <li>Sharing huge files on a different service like <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/google-drive">Google Drive</a>.</li>
        <li>Simply creating a backup of your working files to another service like <a href="{{ site.url }}/connectors/box">Box</a>.</li>
      </ul>
