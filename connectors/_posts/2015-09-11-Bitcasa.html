      <h2>Mover and {{ page.html_title }}</h2>

      <p><b>Mover has retired all support for Bitcasa and <u>does not</u> currently support their CloudFS API.</b></p>

      <p>As a world leader in cloud migrations and backups, Mover is proud to partner with Bitcasa!</p>

      <p>Bitcasa is one of the largest, and certainly one of the most secure, cloud storage providers in the world. With file sync and share capabilities to rival any other provider, Bitcasa also offers a full suite of developer platform tools.</p>

      <p>On November 15th, 2014, Bitcasa retired their original cloud storage platform and introduced CloudFS. Any outstanding Bitcasa customers were required to migrate their data to the new CloudFS storage system.</p>
