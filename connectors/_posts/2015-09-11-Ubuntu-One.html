      <h2>Mover and {{ page.html_title }}</h2>

      <p><b>With the closure of the Ubuntu One service, this connector is no longer available through Mover.</b></p>

      <p>Ubuntu One was a world class file sync and share product from Canonical, the company behind the industry leading Ubuntu Linux distribution.</p>

      <p>The Ubuntu One service enabled users to store files in the cloud and to sync them between the web and mobile devices. With multiple options for varying platforms, Ubuntu One integrated into Windows, Linux, and programs like Mozilla Thunderbird.</p>

      <p>On April 2, 2014, Canonical announced shutting down of Ubuntu One services. As of the day of announcement, it is no longer possible to purchase storage or music. File services will be unavailable from June 1, but existing users will be able to download their content until July 31, when all stored data will be permanently deleted.</p>

      <h3>Transfer for Free</h3>
      
      <p>Mover offered full support to all Ubuntu One users who were seeking to migrate to a new platform before the deadline in the summer of 2014. As part of our belief in the future of the cloud and cloud storage, we allowed any Ubuntu One users to transfer their files for free.</p>
