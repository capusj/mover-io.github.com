      <p>SugarSync is a powerhouse cloud synchronization service.</p>

      <p>Being able to share and synchronize your files across all your devices with SugarSync makes life much simpler, and now with the Mover SugarSync Connector, your files can now reach devices beyond SugarSync as well!</p>

      <p>This Connector works with all of Mover’s services, allowing you to take advantage of differential transfers, scheduling, archiving, and Mover’s bi-directional compatibility. Users can now manage their files in new ways such as these:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Backing up SugarSync files onto separate cloud services.</li>
        <li>Moving files to or from storage sites that do not have SugarSync readily available.</li>
        <li>Setting up schedules for file migration and backup with SugarSync and other cloud storage services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We here at Mover take security very seriously, and ensure that your files are protected whenever using our services.
      Each transfer made is encrypted end-to-end and we are constantly revising and improving our security practices.</p>

      <p>Our Security Overview is a really great read, and we encourage all our users to take a moment to review it.</p>

      <p>Mover’s SugarSync Connector is aimed to help you better manage your files with SugarSync and other services.</p>
